# oven hardware

CAD files for fast-loading oven.
Contents:

- 'single oven'
This is the original design for our single-species oven. This is included for reference, and improvements could be ported from the dual oven design.

- 'dual oven'
The second iteration design, incorporating a second tube for two species.
This design also improves on some of the mechanical aspects, most notably the clamping mechanism and the mechanical strength of the ceramic back-piece.
